<h1>About Us</h1>
<p>we started with a mission to provide fresh quality spices to restaurants and local food service facilities and that mission is still true today, more than 20 years later.

In 1994, owner David Tenenbaum envisioned a unique opportunity to hand package spices for delivery to local Denver restaurants.  His vision grew into a thriving business and The Rocky Mountain Spice Company was formed.  As the company has continued to grow over the past 20 years, they have increased in facility size and offering.  Today, the Rocky Mountain Spice Company employs over 50 people and operates a 40,000 s.f. facility in Denver.</p>
